        <p>CCIT-CINEMA is a prototype made by Owen Tan Yik Wen, Monica Natalia, and La Ode Isaac Ibrahim H. This prototype is used only for studies and webpage development in order to gain knowledge from making this web. This web is quite far from perfect, therefore it will be a good practice for our own skill development on developing in html.</p>
        <p>We chose cinema-themed web for our practice as the theme itself will be the perfect web for us to practice with as it is quite simple and lets us learn and develop the web way easier. Compared toother themes, cinema is one of the most convenient theme for beginners who are trying to make a webpage. It lets us tinker with posters, sliders, font styles, columns, etc.</p>
        <p>With this theme, we now understand the advanced basics on how html, css, and js works. For other people it may seem easy but for us, it is quite hard to develop as we have to do a lot of trials and error on making this web prototype. With those trials and errors, we've finally finished this cinema webpage.</p>
